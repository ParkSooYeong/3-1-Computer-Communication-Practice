            JavaScript (/ˈdʒɑːvəˌskrɪpt/),[8] often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification.[9]
            JavaScript is high-level, often just-in-time compiled, and multi-paradigm.
            It has curly-bracket syntax, dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions.
            Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web.[10]
            JavaScript enables interactive web pages and is an essential part of web applications.
            The vast majority of websites use it for client-side page behavior,[11] and all major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute it.
