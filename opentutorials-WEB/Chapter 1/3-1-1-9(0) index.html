        <h2>WEB</h2>

        <p>
            The World Wide Web (WWW), commonly known as the Web, is an information system where documents and other web resources are identified by Uniform Resource Locators
            (URLs, such as https://example.com/), which may be interlinked by hyperlinks, and are accessible over the Internet.[1][2]
            The resources of the Web are transferred via the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), may be accessed by users by a software application called a web browser,
            and are published by a software application called a web server.
            The World Wide Web is not synonymous with the Internet, which pre-dated the Web in some form by over two decades and upon which technologies the Web is built.
